** Configuration
Before using this library, you can configure the variables =default-currency= and =default-rounding-mode= in a configuration file named =config.edn=, that should be located in the root directory of the project.

For example, for using /euros/ as the default currency, and the /half even/ method as the default rounding method, the content of the =config.edn= file should be:
#+begin_src clojure
  {:default-currency :eur
   :default-rounding-mode :half-even}
#+end_src
